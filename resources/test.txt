Quiet wind.123The evening is blue and frowning.
I look with wide eyes.
In Persia the chickens are just like this,
as we have in strawy Ryazan.

The same month, only a little wider,
A little more yellow and on the other side.
You and I love in this world
The same sdsadasd234234  everyone else, darling.

The nights are warm, I can't help it, I can't help it,
I can't help but praise and sing them.
So do the girls here e34mbrace their sweethearts
Till the second cock crowing, till the third cock crowing.

Ah, love! It's a fe111eling everyone knows,
It's a feeling even cats know,
But I'm with my country and without a home
I scrape together crumbs from it.

I'm not happy. But I won't grieve
There are chickens everywhere that are dear to my heart,
I've got young sensual fools
Young sensual fools.

With them I take all my joys
And for them I only speak in verse:
â€œThat's why people love the earth,
Because it smells of roosters.
